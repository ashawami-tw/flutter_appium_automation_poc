## About POC on Appium using Flutter app

- [Sample Flutter APP] is used to write this tests
- tests are written using appium-flutter-driver under `flutter` folder
- tests are written using UiAutomator2/XCUITest under `test` folder
- reporting is done using allure-report
- tests using appium-flutter-driver

| Locators for flutter components are same as locators used in dart language e.g. bySemanticsLabel |             Need to switch between native and flutter driver using Native context             |
|                           Test suite can be run on any apk/ipa version                           |           Appiumâ€™s Flutter driver does not support apps built in the release mode.            |
|           NPM package is available for appium flutter driver and appium flutter finder           |                           Does not support finding list of elements                           |
|                 Runs tests faster if compared with UiAutomator2/XCUITest drivers                 |      [Flutter Pre-requisite] need to be updated in code base and then build the apk/ipa       |
|                                                -                                                 | Cannot inspect flutter widget using appium inspector. Need to inspect using flutter inspector |
|                                                -                                                 |                Functionalities such as scroll, swipe etc is tough to implement                |

- tests using UiAutomator2 driver

| Locators are same as used for any other apk e.g. id, class etc |              Locator strategy for flutter widget, if accessibility id is not present have to rely on xpath              |
|               Can automate native functionality                |                  have to maintain separate locators for iOS and Android if accessibility id is missing                  |
|            Test suite can be run on any apk version            |                      The way accessibility id, text are reflected on UiAutomator is not consistent                      |
|                    Large community support                     | if from [Flutter Pre-requisite] `enableFlutterDriverExtension()` added in `main.dart` some of the functionality differs |
|            No pre-requisite needed to build the app            |                                                                                                                         |

# PactumJS

## Installation

```
npm i
npm run api-test
```

## Dependencies to run API tests

- [Personal Access Token] - create github access token and use as `GITHUB_BEARER_TOKEN` under `.env` file

## Reporting

`report` folder will be generated after running tests which will contain `mochasome-report` and `api-json-report`

## About POC on PactumJS

- [PactumJS] is Free & OpenSource REST API Testing Tool
- Mocha framework is used to write the tests
- It supports
  - CRUD operations
  - Response Schema validation
  - Authentication
  - it uses builder style to write the tests
  - `toss()` function
    - can be used to separate API call and assertions
    - it also returns the response
  - Default headers can be set on test suit level
  - retry mechanism
- Reporting can be done
  - using `pactum-json-reporter` which shows all API calls made
  - using `mochawesome' reporting can be used for number of tests Passed/Failed
- For this POC GitHub REST API are used
  - tests
    - Create new repository
    - Delete repository
    - Get repository details
    - Change repository from public mode to private mode
  - API calls and validations are seperated
  - base test is added which does the setup for all the tests
- [PactumJS GitHub Repository] is maintained, last published 3 months ago
- New if compared with Supertest
- Test Result -<img width="1216" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-13 at 1 04 19 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87519889/224644782-16222c99-2f76-473c-9df6-ce0ef1d59938.png">


## Next Steps

- Compare with other tools such as `supertest`
- Timeout handling
- Running as part of pipeline
- Decision on creating different framework for API Tests or maintaining them under single framework which contains UI + API tests
  - Impact of maintaining UI + API tests in single framework depends on following criteria
    - duplications of data
    - duplication of services such as SMS service
    - Impact while running tests on BrowserStack
    - Scalability
